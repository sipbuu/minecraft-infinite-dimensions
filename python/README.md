# Source python files for the project

This contains the **project python files** which is the code used within this project, which is then compiled into an exe file using [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)

There are different versions for each file, if you would like to look into the file that allows you to **customize the time between each loop** then look for the file "*randomwarp_custom.py*" or just [click here](https://github.com/sipbuu/minecraft-infinite-dimensions/blob/main/python/randomwarp_custom.py)

If you are looking for the version where it is 3 minutes between each loop then look for the file "*randomwarp_3minutes.py* or just [click here](https://github.com/sipbuu/minecraft-infinite-dimensions/blob/main/python/randomwarp_3minutes.py)

# Requirementes for python file / Errors with the python file

For the python file you may **require some dependencies** such as **win32**, and **win32gui**, etc, which you can **get by typing** `pip install pywin32` or **by running** `python -m pip install pywin32`

If the **python file continues saying** that ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'win32gui`` then look over here at [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72091179), and if that doesnt work then look for other solutions

Another issue **might be the version of python** that you are using, I'm currently unsure of the reason as to why the error occurs but it just happens as a glitch.
