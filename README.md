# Random Warps for 20w14infinite

Python program with the usage and intention of teleporting players by using the minecraft server command prompt hosted on a **local server**/**on the same pc** (on version 20w14infinite, as the name states) and executes commands that teleport all players to a randomly selected dimension either 3 minutes or a custom number chosen by you!

## Credits

- [Besteres](https://github.com/Besteres) - **Made** the [original project for the file](https://github.com/Besteres/RandomWarps20w14) which allowed for the generation of the random warps, and for players through the server console to be warped there.
- [Sipbuu](https://github.com/Sipbuu) - **Modified** the original base code and made some **QOL life changes** (such as the timer w/ the datapack) and some changes with the **generation of the warps** from the original file.
